### Why?
There's nothing behind it. It's just a page that I decided to create for practice some concepts.

Some of these are:
- Trigonometry
- SVG file
- Manipulation of DOM

### Some trigonometry
There are planty ways to end in the same result.

But in case you're wondering how, in this case, handling clocks are ubicated, you can think of them easly as the following graphs:

Where
- Minute and Second hands are represented by
    - X: green wave
    - Y: orange wave
- Hour hand are represented by
    - X: blue wave
    - Y: purple wave

Note how each period coincide with it's range
- Minute & Second - 60 units 
- Hour - 12 units _(though in one day are 24 units, the hand repeats every 12 units)_
